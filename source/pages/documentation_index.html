    <h1>Ansible Automation Ecosystem</h1>
    <p class="lead">A complete solution for bare-metal provisioning and Kubernetes cluster deployment.</p>
    
    <h2>Welcome to the Documentation Hub</h2>
    <p>This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of a fully automated infrastructure ecosystem built with Ansible. The system is designed to take bare-metal servers from power-on to fully configured, production-ready Kubernetes nodes with zero manual intervention.</p>
    <p>The entire process is broken down into two main Ansible projects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Provisioning Server:</strong> A dedicated server that provides all the necessary network services (DHCP, TFTP, HTTP) to automate the installation of the Ubuntu operating system on new machines.</li>
        <li><strong>The Kubernetes Cluster:</strong> A set of Ansible roles that configure the newly provisioned servers into a complete Kubernetes cluster, ready to deploy applications.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to Use This Documentation</h3>
    <p>Use the sidebar navigation to explore the different components of the system. Each section provides detailed explanations of the architecture, configuration, and execution steps involved.</p>
