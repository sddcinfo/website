<h1>The Provisioning Server</h1>
<p class="lead">The automated provisioning process is a two-phase system. First, a virtual machine is created to act as the central provisioning server. Second, this server is used to deploy Ubuntu onto bare-metal hardware automatically.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Phase 1: Creating the Provisioning Server VM</h2>
    <p>The process begins by creating a dedicated virtual machine that will orchestrate the entire bare-metal deployment. This is handled by the <a href="https://github.com/sddcinfo/vmware-automation" target="_blank">vmware-automation</a> project, which contains a set of Python scripts designed to run on a machine with VMware Workstation installed.</p>
    <p>The workflow is as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A blank "template" VM is first created in VMware Workstation with a predefined hardware configuration (4GB RAM, 2 CPUs, 25GB disk).</li>
        <li>The <code>create-vm.py</code> script is executed, which clones this template to create a new VM, named <code>provisioning-server</code> by default.</li>
        <li>The script then generates a custom cloud-init ISO using <code>create-cidata-iso.py</code>. This ISO contains the autoinstall configuration needed for an unattended Ubuntu 24.04 installation.</li>
        <li>The script attaches the Ubuntu 24.04 installation ISO and the newly created cloud-init ISO to the VM and powers it on.</li>
        <li>Ubuntu's autoinstall process reads the configuration from the cloud-init ISO and installs the operating system without any user interaction.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At the end of this phase, a fully installed Ubuntu 24.04 VM is running and ready to be configured by Ansible.</p>

    <h2>Phase 2: Configuring the Server with Ansible</h2>
    <p>With the base VM running, the <a href="https://github.com/sddcinfo/ansible-provisioning-server" target="_blank">ansible-provisioning-server</a> project takes over. This Ansible playbook, run directly on the provisioning server VM, installs and configures a suite of services that work in concert to guide a new, bare-metal machine through its own automated installation of Ubuntu.</p>

    <h3>Core Provisioning Services</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>dnsmasq (DHCP/TFTP/DNS):</strong> This is the first point of contact for a new node. When a bare-metal machine is powered on and set to PXE boot, it sends out a DHCP request. Dnsmasq is configured to listen for these requests, assign a specific IP address based on the node's MAC address (defined in <code>nodes.json</code>), and provide the iPXE bootloader via its built-in TFTP server. It also acts as a local DNS resolver for the provisioning network.</li>
        <li><strong>Nginx & PHP (Web Server):</strong> The web server is the main engine of the provisioning process. It hosts the iPXE boot script, the unpacked Ubuntu ISO files, and the cloud-init autoinstall configurations. It also serves a simple PHP-based web interface to monitor the status of each node.</li>
        <li><strong>iptables (NAT Gateway):</strong> To allow the newly provisioned nodes to access the internet for package downloads, the provisioning server is also configured to act as a NAT gateway, masquerading traffic from the internal network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Server Management & Control</h3>
    <p>A key part of the automation is the ability to control the bare-metal servers themselves. This is accomplished through Redfish, a standard API for server management.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Supermicro Update Manager (SUM):</strong> For advanced BIOS configuration, such as setting the boot order, the playbook uses Supermicro's official <code>sum</code> utility. The <code>set_boot_order.yml</code> playbook automates the process of setting the boot order to PXE first, which is essential for the provisioning process to begin.</li>
        <li><strong>Redfish Python Script (<code>redfish.py</code>):</strong> A custom Python script is included to send Redfish commands to the servers. This is used by the playbooks to perform actions like setting the one-time boot device to the BIOS, allowing for configuration changes before the OS installation.</li>
    </ul>
